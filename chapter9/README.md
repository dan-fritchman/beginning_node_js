# Chapter 9: Front End Basics

The "front-end" part of this is largely a failure. 
*Beginning Node.js* was published in 2014, and really serves as a testament to how fast the web-frameworks du jour tend to move. 
Running through the examples in 2019, it's amazing how quickly, how much has fallen out of date. 
Syed uses AngularJS, which has since been replaced, and API-incompatible versions of a few other libraries. 
After spending a few minutes attempting to dig up the relevant versions, 
I realized I'd prefer to learn this content anew, with tutorials from 2019.  

The server-side facets of *chapter9*, on the other hand, work as planned. 
They implement a simple "to do list", which is really just a collection of items, 
tracked in MongoDB.
